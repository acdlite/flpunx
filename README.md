Flpunx
======

[![build status](https://img.shields.io/travis/acdlite/flpunx.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/acdlite/flpunx)

Better than all the other Flux libraries combined!

What the Flux?
--------------

Super minimal and modular and fluxible. Look how clean the [source](index.js) is.

Get ready to Flux it up.

Usage
-----

All examples are in ES6/7/2015/next, so if you have any trouble reading it, you can go flux yourself.

```js
// Import modularly. So clean.
import { flux, relay, flummox, fluxxor, alt, fluxible, reflux, marty, mcfly } from 'flpunx';

(async () => {
  // Just use it here! That's it! It couldn't be easier!
})();
```

Roadmap
-------

- [ ] Add more flux puns to the README.md
- [ ] Submit pull request to the [Flux Comparison repo](https://github.com/voronianski/flux-comparison).
- [ ] Spam [@reactjs](https://twitter.com/reactjs) on Twitter until they retweet us.
- [ ] Create channel in [Reactiflux](http://reactiflux.com/).
- [ ] Add pronunciation guide.
- [X] ~~Annihilate the entire repo once Relay is released.~~ Be even better than Relay.
- [ ] Include a link to my personal Twitter account and ask people to follow me

If someone can think of a better pun on the word "flux," let me know and I'll create a new library that's even better than this one.
